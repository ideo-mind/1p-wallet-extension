- **Sepolia Testnet**: Ready for testing

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Chrome browser
- Creditcoin Testnet account with 1P tokens (for registration)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build extension
npm run build

# Development mode (watch)
npm run dev
```

### Load Extension in Chrome

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Watch mode for development
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run lint` - Lint code
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run type-check` - TypeScript type checking

### Technology Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript 5** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS 3** - Styling
- **shadcn/ui** - UI components
- **Ethers.js 6** - Ethereum interactions
- **Webpack 5** - Bundling

## Features

### Registration Flow

1. Choose username (format: `username.1p`)
2. Enter single secret character
3. Confirm secret
4. Wallet created with custodial address

### Authentication

- Visual grid challenges with colored letters
- Direction inputs: Red=UP, Green=DOWN, Blue=LEFT, Yellow=RIGHT, Skip
- Adaptive difficulty (1-30 rounds)
- Keyboard support: Arrow keys, WASD, Space/Enter

### Wallet Dashboard

- View custodial address and username
- ETH and $1P token balances
- Transaction history
- Quick actions (Send, Receive, Buy $1P)

### dApp Integration

- EIP-1193 compliant `window.ethereum` provider
- Compatible with MetaMask-based dApps
- Supports: `eth_requestAccounts`, `personal_sign`, `eth_sendTransaction`
- Works with Uniswap, OpenSea, and other Ethereum dApps

## Testing

### Test with Sample dApp

A test dApp is included in `test-dapp/index.html`. To use:

```bash
# Serve the test dApp
npx serve test-dapp
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 and test wallet connection, signing, and transactions.

## Current Status

### ✅ Implemented

- Project setup with TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS
- Core type definitions and protocol constants
- Mock backend and contract services
- Type-safe storage service with encryption
- Registration flow components
- Authentication challenge UI (Grid, Direction Input)
- Wallet dashboard
- EIP-1193 provider injection
- Background service worker with message router

### ✅ Smart Contract & Backend Integration

The wallet is now integrated with:

- **OneP Contract** on Creditcoin Testnet
  - On-chain username registration (costs 100 1P tokens)
  - Authentication attempt requests with fee payment
  - User profile and state management
- **Backend Verifier Service**
  - Registration verification with signatures
  - Challenge generation for authentication
  - Solution verification

**Registration Flow:**
1. User enters username, password (single character), and color-direction mapping
2. Extension generates a new wallet for the user
3. **Automatic funding** - Creator account (from `EVM_CREATOR_PRIVATE_KEY`) sends:
   - 0.1 tCTC (native tokens for gas fees)
   - 110 1P tokens (100 for registration fee + 10 for future authentication fees)
   - If creator account has insufficient funds, registration continues but user is notified to manually fund
4. New wallet pays 100 1P tokens to register username on-chain
5. Backend verifier creates custodial account after signature verification
6. Wallet private key is encrypted with user's password and stored locally

**Unlock Flow:**
1. User enters password to decrypt wallet
2. **Balance check** - verifies wallet has sufficient funds for authentication
   - If insufficient, user is warned but unlock proceeds
3. Wallet pays attempt fee in 1P tokens to request authentication
4. Backend generates challenges based on user's legend
5. User solves challenges by selecting directions
6. Backend verifies solutions and unlocks wallet

### 📋 TODO

- Add transaction confirmation popups for dApp requests
- Implement PERSONAL_SIGN authentication flow in background worker
- Implement SEND_TRANSACTION authentication flow in background worker
- Add origin approval management UI
- Implement profile editing
- Add $1P token purchasing/transfer flow
- Implement session management
- Add error tracking
- Write comprehensive tests
- Add internationalization

## Creator Account Requirements

For the automatic funding feature to work during registration:

- The creator account (specified by `EVM_CREATOR_PRIVATE_KEY`) must have:
  - **0.2+ tCTC** per registration (for gas fees to send both transactions)
  - **110+ 1P tokens** per registration:
    - 110 tokens sent to new wallet (100 for registration + 10 for auth fees)
- If insufficient funds, registration will continue but users must manually fund their wallets

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Features**:

- User's secret character is **NEVER stored** locally or transmitted
- Wallet private key is **encrypted** using AES-GCM with user's password
- Creator private key is only used for initial funding, never stored in extension
- All dApp interactions require authentication
- Origin validation for all external requests
- Minimal permissions (only `storage` and `unlimitedStorage`)
